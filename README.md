# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Sanity CMS

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.0)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).
In this project I use ISG to serve dynamic like pages as if they were static pages. As a content menagment system I used Sanity and as a query language I used GROQ.
